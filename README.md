# CONTACTS CRUD

This project resolves the following statement:

```dotnetcli
We want a React + Backend application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts. 
Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email, and phone number.
All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email. 
The contacts will be persisted in the database.
```

## Tecnologies

As the statement says, the frontend must be donde with React JS. By cortesy of the developer, React uses Typescript. From the other hand, the backend is implemented using Ruby on Rails.
