# CONTACTS CRUD

This project resolves the following statement:

```
We want a React + Backend application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts. 
Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email, and phone number.
All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email. 
The contacts will be persisted in the database.
```

## Tecnologies

As the statement says, the frontend must be donde with React JS. From the other hand, the backend is implemented using Ruby on Rails.
